//A=B*C â€“2*(B+C) in order to compute this function, a bidmas approach is used;
//Lines 2,3,4,5,6: starting by adding the B and C matrix inside the equation. Add
                   by iterating each list representing a column and a row in the matrix;
//Lines 8,9,10,11: then scale the result obtained from the previous function by two;
//Lines 13,14,15,16,17:the same way the adding functon was implemented, a multiplication
                       function is added which will compute B*C;
//Lines 19,20,21,22: finally the last subtraction function follows the same structure
                     as addition and multiplication, where multiplication_result and scaled
                     result are added as arguments.
                     These are subtracted and the result is outputed in line 23.
